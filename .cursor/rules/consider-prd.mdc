# Product Requirements Document (PRD) Reference

Always reference and consider the Product Requirements Document located at `docs/prd.md` when:

- Making architectural decisions
- Adding new features or components
- Writing or modifying code
- Answering questions about the project
- Suggesting improvements or changes

When implementing features, ensure they align with the PRD's vision, tech stack, and MVP scope. Always maintain consistency with the established architecture and user experience goals.
